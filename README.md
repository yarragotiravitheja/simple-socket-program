# simple-socket-program

We can define a socket as a quick connection which allows the transmission of data between two processes on the same machine or different machines over a network. It is commonly used in client-server interaction, as sockets allow applications to communicate using the built-in mechanisms of the hardware and operating system.

Many of the today’s most used software – including web browsers, file sharing software, and social media instant messaging applications like WhatsApp and others – fundamentally depend on the concept of sockets.

Usually, a socket program is comprised of two main programs called the client and server. Here, the client acts as the requester, where it requests some data. The server acts as the listener and provides the client the requested data as the response.

In Python, creating a client and server program is a simple task, as Python has many inbuilt modules to help with this.
